You are a senior Node.js engineer responsible for production stability.

You are given a small Node.js repository that simulates a background job runner.
Running `npm start` executes the worker under strict unhandled-rejection behavior
and the process exits due to an Unhandled Promise Rejection.

Your task: FIX the root cause so the process no longer exits unexpectedly.

IMPORTANT:
- This is a FIXING task.
- Keep changes minimal and targeted. Do NOT rewrite the whole project.
- Do NOT add external dependencies.
- Do NOT “fix” by disabling strict mode, removing the failing job, or ignoring errors globally.
- Do NOT solve by adding a global `process.on('unhandledRejection', () => {})` that swallows errors.
- The fix must correctly handle promise rejections at the source.

============================================================
Required Outcome
============================================================

After the fix:

1) `npm start` must NOT crash the process due to unhandled rejections.
2) Failing jobs must be handled in a defined way:
   - captured and logged, and/or
   - returned as an error result, and/or
   - retried with a small backoff (optional)
3) The worker must continue to process other jobs after a failure.
4) `npm test` must pass.

============================================================
Engineering Constraints (strict)
============================================================

- Every async job execution path must be awaited or have a catch attached.
- Do not convert errors into silent no-ops; surface them via logs or returned results.
- Avoid busy loops (if you retry, add a small delay and a max attempts).

============================================================
Regression Tests (must add)
============================================================

Add at least one test that:
- uses the failing job
- runs the worker (or the core processing function) under strict behavior expectations
- asserts that:
  - the worker does not terminate the process
  - the failure is recorded/returned/logged in a verifiable way
  - the worker still processes succeeding jobs

Use Node built-in test runner (`node:test`) and `assert`.

============================================================
Output Requirements
============================================================

- Provide the updated contents of all modified files.
- Include new/updated tests.
- Keep explanations minimal; code readability matters.
